**{{ site.title }}** is a community of developers, designers, tech-enthusiasts
and tech-startups in Innsbruck.

We aim to bring the local scene together in a relaxed atmosphere to exchange
knowledge, collaborate and have fun.

Above all we want to do our part in making Innsbruck a great and welcoming place
to work in the design, development and startup space.

You would like to contribute or have a job listing that we should post? Just
contact us at <{{ site.email }}> or get in touch with one of the organisers
below.
